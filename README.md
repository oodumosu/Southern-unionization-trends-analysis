Please review the code in Unionization analysis V3.Rmd. The results can be checked against the figures used in the publication (https://urbanorg.box.com/s/0ei1f0y1n0yauyybtmycuki5r6s14jj9):
- 26% of Southern workers earn less than $17 per hour
- In 2024, retail industry jobs alone made up nearly 16 percent of all Southern employment
- Data for figures 1 and 2 in unionionization_analysis_8.13.xlsx
Thank you!
